This content was previously available on WikiPedia but deleted as not really encylopaedia-worthy. Since an article of mine was originally a major source for the data in the page, I took a copy for posterity. It's now here on Github to and publically editable by all.

The HTML version is available in `legacy.md` (stored this way so Github renders it) and contains the rendered Wikipedia page as it was when it was taken down. For up to date entries (and to make changes)
see the [email2sms.csv](email2sms.csv) file — a text CSV file which has been cleaned and restructured. PRs welcome.

## What is this?

This is a list of carriers providing Short Message Service (SMS) transit via SMS gateways.

This list explains which email address to use if one wants to send an email and have it arrive as a text message on someone’s phone. The number must contain no punctuation. For instance, to send to a number typically expressed in the United States as 987-555-0100, one would email 9875550100@SMS-gateway.

Some carriers have multiple gateways. The SMS gateway refers to Short Message Services which are capable of transmitting plain text messages only. MMS refers to “Multimedia Messaging Services” which are generally capable of carrying messages which include text, pictures and audio.
